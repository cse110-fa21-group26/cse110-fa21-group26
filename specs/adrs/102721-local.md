# Decisions about the storing database locally vs remotely

## Users' local library 10/27/2021
### Context and Problem Statement
Since this is a C.R.U.D. application, users have the ability to create and update recipies into their local library, so we needed to decide where to store this local library
### Considered Options
1. Server-side
2. Client-side
### Decision Outcome
To fulfill the CRUD features of this app we allow users to create, edit, and delete local recipes that are only available to the user with local access. We want to maintain simplicity by keeping local data offline and have these recipes only available to the user.
