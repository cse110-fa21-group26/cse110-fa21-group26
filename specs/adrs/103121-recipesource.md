# Decisions about the source of our reciep database 

### Context and Problem Statement
We need to populate our app with recipies, so we needed to decide the location from where we would get these recipies
### Considered Options
1. Webscraping
2. Spoonacular API
3. Fill ourselves
### Decision Outcome
After looking at all three options, we decided to use spoonacular API since it seemed like the easiest to use and automate while also providing the gratest amount of
information on our recipies and letting us filter by tags. We want to try using the Spoonacular API to collect and scrape recipes for us to display on our homepage.
This API will hopefully make it easy for us to display many recipes on our page in an automated fashion.
