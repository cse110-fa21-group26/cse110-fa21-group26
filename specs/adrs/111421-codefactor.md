# Decision made about code quality

## Context and Problem Statement
We needed a way to maintain code quality with every pull request made. We were recommended to use codefactor.io.
## Considered options
1. codefactor.io
## Decision Outcome
We integrated codefactor.io into our github repository to see if it would help us maintain code quality. After a couple of times of seeing suggestions when we tried to pull into main we decided we would keep it since it really did help keep our code from becoming messy.
