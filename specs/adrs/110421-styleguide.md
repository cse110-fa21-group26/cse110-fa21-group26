# Decisions about style guides

### Context and Problem Statement
We chose a style guide to base our code off of so that our group has something to refer to when coding to style their code so that we have uniform styling.
### Considered Options
1. Google
2. Airbnb
3. StandardJS
### Decision Outcome
We chose to go with google because they have easy to read rules on formatting and are widley used by other platforms
