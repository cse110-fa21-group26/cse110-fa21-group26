# Decision made for a favorites page

## Context and Problem Statement 
We wanted our users to be able to have all their favorite recipes in their own favorites page.
## Considered Options 
1. Allow the user to favorite the recipe for easy access
## Deccision Outcome 
Since we did not have a lot of time to make this feature work properly, we decided to scrap this idea from our original plans. Instead we focused on the main CRUD features of our web application.
