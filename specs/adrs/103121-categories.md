# Decisions about recipe categories

### Context and Problem Statement
When entering our web application, the number of recipes available without any categorical filtering makes it difficult for users to easy navigate to certain classes of recipes that they are uniquely interested in. 
### Considered Options
1. Create search filter
2. Create categories for recipes
3. Personalize page based on user data
### Decision Outcome
To cater towards the experience of the user, we decided to use categories on the main page of oru app with categories based on the user personas we original developed. We may still implement a search feature, but this is the most acccessible way of orgnaizing recieps based on some categorical relevance.
