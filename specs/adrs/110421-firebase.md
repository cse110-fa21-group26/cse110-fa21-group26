# Decisions about where to host our web application

### Context and Problem Statement
For hosting our web application online, Github pages is an inappropriate domain to be hosting a website. Instead, we need to use a tier 1 or tier 2 cloud vendor to host the domain of our web application.
### Considered Options
1. Google Firebase
2. Azure
### Decision Outcome
We decided to use Google Firebase to host our web application because we were generally familiar with Google and its branding gave us confidence of the quality of the service.
