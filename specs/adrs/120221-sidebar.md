# Decision about whether to keep or remove the sidebar interface

### Context and Problem Statement
The number of options in our sidebar is heavily limited and we are questioning whether or not to keep it. Using it takes up a lot of visual real estate from the web app and its fnutionality introduced uneeded complexity. 
### Considered Options
1. Remove sidebar funcitnality completely and put its components in the top level of the web application.
2. Add more features to the sidebar to justify its presence
### Decision Outcome
We decided to completely remove the sidebar because it doesn't make sense to arbitrarily add functionality to it only to justify it. Instead, by removing it, it cleans up the web UI and makes it more acessible; eloquent simplicity.
