# Decisions about the theme of the web application

## Create Theme for our app
### Context and Problem Statement
As recommended by the professor during office hours, we wanted to discuss if we should create our app based on a niche. This narrows range that our site covers which could make it simpler.
### Considered Options
1. Vegetarian Application
2. Breakfast Application
3. No Theme
### Decision Outcome
Firstly, we decided we wanted a theme since we were informed by the professor that this will make it easier to make a good application since it narrows the scope of our site.
We initially wanted to design a vegetarian recipe app, but we pivoted to a breakfast recipes app. We felt that it was an easier scope to cover, as the ingredients of breakfast recipes are simpler and more consistent. It would allow for us to have easier defined categories and more consistent recipe formatting. Overall: exchanging reduced scope of user domain to reduced scope of service domain.
