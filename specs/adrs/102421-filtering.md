# Decisions about filtering options on the webapp

## Adding Complex Features 10/24/2021
### Context and Problem Statement
When designing our app, we need to decide who to cater to. If you are a chef, you may want more features; however, if you are a novice, you want a simple and to the point recipe application
### Considered Options
1. Gear for chef
2. Gear for novice
3. Gear for both by not facing user with complex features
### Decision Outcome
To cater to users that have more experience, the sidebar (which itself is very acessble) will have many options for filtering, creating custom recipes, favouriting, creating an account, etc... all tools for the more expeienced. So these features will exist but they will not take from the spotlight of very accessible recipes / interfaces for those who are not as familiar.

## Difficulty filter toggle accessible on "easy by default" and accessible at the category page level 10/24/2021
Again, to allow accessibilty for new cooks... but the toggle being very accessible makes it easy for experienced cooks to quickly dive into all possible recipes ratehr than beginner ones.
