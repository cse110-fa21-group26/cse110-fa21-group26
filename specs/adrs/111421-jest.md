# Decisions about Testing our webapp

## Context and Problem Statement 
As recommended, we needed to have testing for our recipe app, to check if it works as we want it to work. Since none of us were very familiar with testing our options were limited
## Considered Options 
1. Jest 
## Deccision Outcome 
Since Jest was the only tool that we were all more familiar with becuase of the class, we decided to use it to test the functionality of our recipe app. This will help us troubleshoot the problems that we have with our code.
