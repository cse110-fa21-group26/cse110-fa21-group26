# Decision about how to present the expanded recipe profile

### Context and Problem Statement
There is a question of how we want the recipes displayed to the user when expanded so that it is accessible to the user.
### Considered Options
1. Present the image of the final result of the recipe and then a section that can toggle between the ingredients and the instructions.
2. Have the instructions presented and have the recipe result image toggleable with the ingredients of the recipe.
### Decision Outcome
The decision outcome was to have the image toggleable with the ingredients that way the user could view the ingredients and instructions side by side. When first opened, the page would display the image first.
