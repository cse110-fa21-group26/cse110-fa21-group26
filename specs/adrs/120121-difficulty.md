# Decision about not having difficulty tabs

## Context and Problem Statement 
We wanted to give difficulty levels for different experienced users to use if they wanted more complicated or more simple recipes.
## Considered Options 
1. Beginner
2. Advanced
## Deccision Outcome 
Since we did not have a lot of time to make this feature work properly, we decided to scrap this idea from our original plans. Instead we focused on the main CRUD features of our web application.
