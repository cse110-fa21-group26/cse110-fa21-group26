As it heats, combine ground beef, Old Bay, pepper and salt. Form into four equally sized patties, about 1/3 lb apiece. Set on a platter next to the stovetop. Coat the warmed grill pan with cooking spray and place patties on the pan, cooking each side about 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through to your desired doneness.  Use a large star-shaped cookie cutter to cut each cheese slice into a star shape. Place the star-shaped cheese on each burger patty, in the last 30 seconds or so of cooking, so it melts a little. Set burger patties aside. <strong>Make King Neptune\u2019s Poseidon Powder Aioli:</strong> Stir mayo and Old Bay until thoroughly combined.  <strong>Assemble the Sandwich:</strong> Spread Poseidon Powder Aioli on the bottom of each bun. Top with a burger patty, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion slices, tomato and lettuce. Place the top bun on each burger. Serve.","video":{"@type":"VideoObject","contentUrl":"https://streaming.hearstdigitalstudios.com/manual_upload/57acfb4bd559300dad53407a/mp4/57acfb4bd559300dad53407a_Krabby_Patty_V4_1470954321_4000_hd_v3.mp4","description":"Plankton would kill to get his hands on this copycat krabby patty.
