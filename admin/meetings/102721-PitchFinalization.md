##  Agenda:

##  Meeting Notes: 
- Decided to pivot app theme to breakfast items instead of vegetarian / vegan options 
- Worked on wireframes ; see Miro
- Pitch:
  1. Problem: Need for a breakfast only app, user wants one-stop for breakfast options, get variety of options for most important meals of the day, organization for breakfast recipes, storing own recipes for later.
  2. Appetite: We have 5 weeks from now, limited scope, student's schedules.
  3. Solution: The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that's easy for people to immediately understand: CRUD features:
    - Create personal recipes
    - Update personal recipes
    - Browse recipes from local machine
    - browse recipes from main page (server)
    - Search query for recipes
    - select recipe
    - load recipe details
  4. Rabit holes: Search: 
    - complexity of our search, depth of filters, how specific out searching is
  5. No-Gos:
    - Non-Breakfast meals ; vastly shrinks scope
    - Cloud storage
  
## Next Meeting:

## Action Items:
